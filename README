Early Childhood Education - Multi-touch  table top game

This project is a project based around research into effective ways to teach pre-school aged children,
through the use of multi-touch technology such as currenly Microsoft Surface 2.0

The application is to be a Bingo styled game with four players guided by a teacher.
The players will then be able to combine the power of a computer to enhance the experience, whilst
having an experience with very low cognitive friction when interacting with the software, due the intuitive 
nature of touch interaction.
This cognitive friction is a barrier that we observed within pre-school settings when children interacted with
conventional desktops and basic interfaces such as MS Paint.

This Bingo game is targeted at teaching young children a variety of skills such as 
basic numeracy, literacy and geometry whilst engaging in an enjoyable way that can provide a variety of challenges.
